# 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Equipment Classification with PyTorch 

Welcome to the **Gym Equipment Classification** project! This project combines deep learning with fitness, using images of gym equipment to train a model that can automatically recognize different types of gear. Built with the power of **PyTorch** and some serious data magic, this classifier can help in applications like fitness apps to recommend workouts based on recognized equipment!

## 🚀 Overview

Check out this project on my [Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/osman0)! I regularly share machine learning and deep learning projects there, and this one is dedicated to improving how we classify gym equipment. In this project, we go from **data preprocessing** to **model training** and all the way to **evaluation**. Each step is crafted to make the classifier as accurate and generalizable as possible.

### Key Stages:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: A sprinkle of augmentation and normalization.
2. **Model Selection**: ResNet18 takes center stage with some fine-tuning for our needs.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: Running the model on the dataset to learn and track performance.
4. **Sample Predictions**: Showcasing some real-world predictions from the model.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Dataset

The dataset includes images of gym equipment, organized into:
- **train**: Training data with various types of equipment.
- **valid**: Validation data to test the model's learning progress.
- **test**: Final test data for evaluating real-world accuracy.

Equipment categories include **dumbbells, elliptical machines, home machines, recumbent bikes**, and more. Data augmentation techniques like random horizontal flips and rotations make our model stronger and more robust.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To get this notebook running, you’ll need:
- **torch** and **torchvision**: The core libraries for building and training deep learning models.
- **matplotlib** and **numpy**: Visualization and numerical processing libraries.
- **seaborn** and **scikit-learn**: For our friendly evaluation metrics.

Install everything with:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The heart of our classifier is **ResNet18**, chosen for its great balance between efficiency and accuracy. The model’s final layer has been fine-tuned to classify different gym equipment categories based on the images in our dataset.

## 🔍 Code Structure

Here's what you can expect in the code:
- **Data Loading and Visualization**: Loads and visualizes samples from the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Applies transformations to boost performance.
- **Model Selection**: Loads and customizes ResNet18 for our needs.
- **Train Model**: Runs the training loop and tracks progress.
- **Evaluate Model**: Evaluates accuracy and shows a confusion matrix.
- **Sample Predictions**: Visualizes some predictions to see how the model performs.

## 📊 Training and Evaluation

The model is trained in a few steps:
1. **Data Augmentation**: Adds variety to our training data.
2. **Training Loop**: Batches data, optimizes with Adam, and learns!
3. **Validation**: Checks model’s performance after each epoch.

### Performance

We measure performance with:
- **Validation Accuracy**: How accurately the model classifies validation images.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows the model’s strengths and weaknesses for each category.

Sample predictions are included for a real-world test!

## 🎉 Results

Our validation accuracy hits approximately **X%** (insert the real number after testing). The confusion matrix reveals which categories the model occasionally mixes up. Overall, it’s a great start and can be expanded further.

## 🌱 Future Work

For the next steps:
- **Expanding the Dataset**: Adding more images or new categories.
- **Testing Other Architectures**: Trying more complex models like ResNet50.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusting settings to fine-tune performance.

## 🛠️ Usage

To try it out yourself:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GymEquipmentClassification.git
   cd GymEquipmentClassification
   ```

2. Organize the dataset into the correct structure (`train/valid/test` folders).

3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to begin training!
