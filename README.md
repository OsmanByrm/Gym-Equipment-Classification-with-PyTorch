# Gym Equipment Classification with PyTorch

This project aims to classify different types of gym equipment images using a deep learning model built with PyTorch. The dataset includes various categories of equipment, such as dumbbells, elliptical machines, and recumbent bikes, with each image classified to help the model learn and identify equipment types accurately. This model can be used in applications like fitness apps that suggest workouts based on recognized equipment.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following key stages:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Images are preprocessed with transformations to normalize and augment the data.
2. **Model Selection**: A pre-trained ResNet18 model is fine-tuned to classify gym equipment images.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained on labeled images, with its performance evaluated through accuracy and a confusion matrix.
4. **Sample Predictions**: The model’s predictions are visualized on a few test images, displaying actual and predicted labels.

## Dataset

The dataset is structured into several folders, organized as follows:
- **train**: Contains images for training the model, divided into subfolders for each category of gym equipment.
- **valid**: Contains validation images, also categorized into folders.
- **test**: Used for final evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data.

Each image in the dataset is classified into one of the following categories:
- Dumbbells
- Elliptical Machine
- Home Machine
- Recumbent Bike
- And potentially more categories based on further data expansion

The dataset is augmented through techniques like random horizontal flipping and rotation to improve model generalization.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the notebook:
- **torch** and **torchvision**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **matplotlib** and **numpy**: For data visualization and numerical operations.
- **seaborn**: To create the confusion matrix.
- **scikit-learn**: For evaluation metrics.

You can install all dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Model Architecture

A pre-trained **ResNet18** model is used for this classification task. The model’s final layer is modified to fit the number of classes in our dataset, allowing it to classify images based on the gym equipment types provided.

The ResNet18 model was chosen for its balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for tasks with limited computational resources.

## Code Structure

- **data_loading_and_visualization**: Load and visualize images from each category to understand the dataset better.
- **data_preprocessing**: Apply transformations for data augmentation and normalization.
- **model_selection**: Load the ResNet18 model and modify the output layer for classification.
- **train_model**: Train the model on the training dataset and track the training and validation loss.
- **evaluate_model**: Evaluate the model's performance on the validation dataset, displaying accuracy and a confusion matrix.
- **sample_predictions**: Visualize model predictions on sample images, showing both actual and predicted labels.

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the following steps:
1. **Data Augmentation**: Random transformations are applied to each image to enhance model generalization.
2. **Training Loop**: The model is trained on batches of images, and the loss is optimized using Adam.
3. **Validation**: After each epoch, validation loss is calculated to track the model’s performance on unseen data.

### Model Performance

The model’s performance is evaluated based on:
- **Validation Accuracy**: A metric indicating how accurately the model classifies validation images.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A visualization showing where the model confuses different categories.

### Example Prediction

Sample predictions are displayed with actual and predicted labels to illustrate the model's classification capabilities.

## Results

The model achieved a validation accuracy of approximately **X%**. The confusion matrix indicates that the model performs well on most categories but occasionally misclassifies certain types of equipment, likely due to visual similarities.

## Future Work

Potential improvements for this project include:
- **Expanding the Dataset**: Adding more images or categories to improve model generalization.
- **Experimenting with Other Architectures**: Testing more complex architectures, such as ResNet50, to enhance accuracy.
- **Fine-tuning Hyperparameters**: Adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, or optimization strategies to improve performance.

## Usage

To reproduce the results:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GymEquipmentClassification.git
   cd GymEquipmentClassification
   ```

2. Ensure the dataset is in the correct folder structure (train/valid/test).

3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to start training.
